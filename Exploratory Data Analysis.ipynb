       "      <td>In August 1986, jazz legend Sonny Rollins and his ensemble performed at Opus 40, a spectacular stone monument in an abandoned bluestone quarry outside Saugerties, a town in upstate New York. Created by pioneering American sculptor, painter and earth artist Harvey Fite, Opus 40 was inspired by Mayan dry-stone construction and scattered rubble was transformed into a series of stone ramps, pedestals and platforms. Rollins chose the site as the monument not only embodied the 'Saxophone Colossus,' his nickname, and the title of his seminal 1956 album, but the stunning and striking visual imagery was a unique backdrop for an open air jazz concert. But as well as being the world premiere of a new Rollins number titled \"G-Man,\" the concert was remembered for a dramatic incident that involved the jazz great misguiding a mid-solo jump from the rock stage and landing heavily on the stone surface six feet below. After a brief and tense pause Rollins continued to play while lying on his back even though it was later learned that he'd broken his heel in the fall. Filmmaker Robert Mugge was there filming his documentary Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Colossus, and captured the moment Rollins fell. \"My initial concern was entirely for Sonny's well-being. That said, I'm a documentary filmmaker, trained to film whatever happens. So, as I ran to see if he was okay, I instructed my four cameramen to keep filming. I should also say that I always try to center my musical portrait films around special moments in the lives of my artist-subjects. In some cases, those moments are events or activities arranged in advance. But in others, we simply happen to be present with cameras running when something unexpected happens.\" The footage of Rollins playing, while lying on his back, in a red sweater, white trousers, and Keds, is some of the punkest in jazz, but the moments before were also some of the most tense. \"Initially, Sonny simply lay there with his eyes closed, leading us to believe that he could have been seriously hurt in the jump,\" Mugge told Noisey via email. \"But when he lifted one leg casually overtop of the other and began to play the opening to \"Autumn Nocturne\" while still lying on his back (a feat of impressive physical strength, in and of itself), all of the previous tension was suddenly released.\" Mugge, who had shot footage of Rollins playing in Tokyo earlier that year, and who had also directed documentaries on Al Green, Gil Scott Herron, and Sun Ra, later learned that during the Optus 40 performance Rollins was growing frustrated with his newly lacquered saxophone. \"Sonny tried to explain away his behavior as simply an effort to go out and play directly to the audience, complicated by poor judgement regarding the distance he would have to jump from the stage,\" explains Mugge. \"But his wife Lucille later revealed to me what he had told her, which was that, sometime after the orchestral premiere in Tokyo, he had had his saxophone lacquered.  \"When he was doing the solo improvising that day, it was as if he would try to play a vowel, but out would come a consonant. Over time, he became so upset by this that he essentially had a nervous breakdown onstage—at least, that's how Lucille described it to me. Of course, Sonny is such a brilliant musician that, if his horn plays a \"wrong note,\" he can instantly create a new musical context in which the \"mistake\" makes fresh musical sense. However, in the film, you can see him beginning to pace back and forth like a caged animal until he finally makes the six-foot leap off of the stage. At the time, it was the only way he could think to end his distress. Sadly, the jump did lead to a personal injury, but it also led to moments of suspense, and then of magic, as he launched into that beautiful ballad, like a sunrise following a dark night. It's the kind of scene that takes on special resonance because it was neither staged nor expected, and because it exemplifies the risk-taking genius of our greatest living jazz improviser.\" \"Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Colossus\", is available in Blu-ray, DVD and digital formats on Aug 4.</td>\n",

Carrey has yet to respond to Alessandra, though she has continued to spar with his defenders and other critics of fascism on Twitter.  Alessandra is already quite famous in Italy, where she’s been a politician for years. Her sympathies for (and even dabblings in) fascism are well-documented. She once abruptly left an Italian political party because its leader denounced fascism as the “absolute evil.” She was also a prominent face of Italy’s 1990 neo-fascist movement. There’s also the time in 2006 when she responded to a transgender critic who called her a fascist by saying: “Meglio fascista che frocio,” which roughly translates to “Better fascist than faggot.” Alessandra also appears to be a fan of President Donald Trump. She frequently retweets Trump and defended him against Carrey’s numerous political cartoons that target the president. Carrey even recently held an exhibit in New York depicting his work.

Some of Alabama’s sex-offender inmates will now be required to undergo chemical castration if they want to be released from prison.  Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed a bill into law on Monday that forces sex offenders whose victims are younger than 13 to take a series of pills that greatly reduce sexual libido as a condition of their parole, according to AL.com. The controversial legislation passed through Alabama’s Statehouse last month, despite it being unclear whether chemical castration works to reduce sex crimes. Alabama is the seventh state, including California, Florida, Montana and Louisiana, to have a chemical castration law, although it’s unclear how often the punishment is utilized. \"This bill is a step toward protecting children in Alabama,\" Ivey said, according to CNN. The inmates will have to pay for their own treatment unless a court rules that’s unreasonable, and will start the process of chemical castration at least one month before they’re released. If parolees stop taking the medication before a court allows it, they’ll be sent back to prison. The procedure can be reversed, and is not as severe as surgical castration, which would remove a man’s testicles.    Want the best of VICE News in your inbox? Sign up here.

Steve Hurst, a Republican, introduced the legislation multiple times over the past several years, and told AL.com Monday he hopes “to track it and to make sure what medical works for what individuals.” He does not consider the law inhumane, and has previously advocated for surgical castration.  \"What’s more inhumane than molesting a small, infant child?' Hurst asked. However, the bill might contradict the Eighth Amendment, which blocks cruel and unusual punishment. A law professor at the University of Florida, John Stinneford, argued in a 2006 paper that such laws should be struck down. Alabama’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union also thinks it runs afoul of the Eighth Amendment, according to AL.com.  “Because chemical castration is designed both to shackle the mind and cripple the body of sex offenders, it is doubly cruel, and should be struck down as a violation of the Eighth Amendment,” Stinneford wrote.

       "      <td>“He is wired differently to you and me, this child of mine. He doesn’t like loud noises, or dark spaces, or strangers touching his head”. These are the first lines from a poem a mother penned about her son 11-year-old son who has Asperger’s syndrome. Sophie Billington goes on to explain how her son Tristan’s brain works differently: “He can see in an instant the pattern, the layout, the solution to a puzzle”, but that “the world judges” and “sees only the outbursts and over-reactions.\" It seems the poem struck a chord, going viral after being posted on Facebook. Although autism is predominantly diagnosed in childhood, increasing numbers of adults are finding out that they too have autism. This issue, of later life diagnosis, was brought to light recently after nature photographer and TV presenter, Chris Packham, went public with his experiences. About one percent of the adult population has been diagnosed as on the autism spectrum, with more people diagnosed with autism than ever before. And yet, generally, the focus on who has autism is still mostly on infants, children and young adults. This is despite the fact that autism can be defined as a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by differences in social communication and interaction with people and wider society, making it very much a label for people of all ages. More from Tonic: There are currently about 3.5 million Americans and 700,000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with autism in some form or another. But of course, there may well be many more who meet the criteria of autism but have not been diagnosed. For these people, they will not have received the care, benefits, support or advice that people with a diagnosis are given. Instead, the judgements made about their behavior may well have led to marginalization, anxiety and insecurity and self-doubt about who they are and how they fit into society. Mental illness can also be more common for people on the autism spectrum, with higher rates of anxiety disorders and depression. These issues may well have developed from experiences of bullying, at home or the workplace, and from being seen as “being a bit odd”. Then there is also the issue that since 2013, definitions of autism have changed. Now, Asperger’s Syndrome—one of several previously separate sub-types of autism—is no longer diagnosed separately, but amalgamated into “Autism Spectrum Disorders.\" This may make some adults feel alienated and unsure about what their diagnosis actually means, as well as what support they may receive. For some adults who are diagnosed later in life, it is likely they have already found ways to cope and be resilient in the face of discrimination and stereotyping. But this is not always the case. Some adults with autism still face daily and lifelong battles to cope in their day-to-day lives. They may also find things like getting a job, meeting new people and having personal relationships really difficult. The UK-based NHS website highlights that it might be a positive step to be diagnosed with autism as an adult—presumably because you may receive support, care, and benefits. To what extent a person will actually receive this additional help is another issue. And given the increasing rates with which children and young people are being diagnosed with autism, it is likely that adults who are diagnosed later on, are going to struggle to access the support they really need. Even when adults do get referred for an assessment for autism they are likely to face lengthy waits and processes—with clinical language being used that can be misunderstood. It can also tend to focus on the deficit rather than the skills of autism, such as creativity, expertise and talents. In this way, then, people who come to an autism diagnosis later in life are likely to continue to experience mental health issues, alongside the stigma, prejudice and discrimination associated with people with learning disabilities. There are of course many different viewpoints to understanding autism, whether they be from a purely medical perspective, or from a social perspective that takes into account cultural and political factors. But rather than seeing autism just as a deficit or something that is “not normal” we need to see it as a way to think about how different people are. Because after all, it is through difference that we learn more, achieve more, and add more substance to day-to-day life in society.

       "      <td>“Slow,” “steady” and “deliberate” are rarely used when describing Uber. But months after an Uber vehicle operating in autonomous mode fatally crashed into a pedestrian, the company has had no choice but to move carefully. After pulling all of its self-driving cars off public roads, laying off all the vehicle operators in Pittsburgh and San Francisco and shutting down its Arizona self-driving operation, Uber is very gradually beginning to prepare to start testing self-driving cars again. That starts with manually driving its fleet of Volvo XC90s in Pittsburgh to map out the streets. Mapping out city streets is essentially square one for testing self-driving cars — that’s a tough spot to be in as a company with serious ambitions for developing autonomous technology, especially in the face of massive competition. But Uber has to move slowly to regain the trust of not just the public, but also city and local governments. This gradual start in Pittsburgh also gives Uber time to implement some of the safety features and changes recommended by an internal team of experts that conducted a review of the company’s self-driving development and operation. Those changes may seem small individually, but together they point to a significant change in how Uber is thinking about self-driving. While much of the inception and some of the way in which the company later operated its self-driving efforts was fueled by competition — specifically with Google parent company Alphabet — the company is now introducing features and technology that prioritize safety. Specifically, Uber is going back to having two people in each car, and will be monitoring its safety drivers — the people who are designated to take over control of the car as needed — in real time. It’s not common for autonomous test cars to be driven with just one person behind the wheel so early in the technology’s development. But around November 2017, Uber switched two safety drivers to one for many of its cars, in part to increase the number of miles each car was driven in autonomous mode, sources told Recode. Miles driven autonomously is just one of many barometers for how advanced a company’s technology is and is how the software driving the cars learns and gains more experience. An Uber spokesperson said that the company decided to make the transition from two drivers to one because the company felt that the role of the second operator — which was to gather information about how well the car was driving itself — could be done after the fact and didn’t have to be done in real time. A byproduct of that, however, is drivers were left alone to determine when to take over control over the car as needed, and there was no one there to ensure they were not distracted. Add to that, the company’s in-car camera system did not detect when a driver was distracted — it simply recorded the driver. That means in order to see whether a driver was distracted at any point in time, a manager had to manually go through the footage after the fact. While sources say that was inefficient in and of itself, it was also exacerbated by how quickly Uber was hiring safety drivers. In Arizona, some managers were in charge of about 25 people, one source said, making it difficult to spot-check whether anyone had unsafe driving behaviors. That said, if a driver was caught doing something unsafe, the company typically had a one-strike policy, sources said. This new off-the-shelf camera system Uber is integrating will instead detect distracted driving in real time, log it into the system automatically, and then make a noise to alert the driver to pay attention. (Similar to a system that startup Nauto has built.) So managers will simply have to look at the software or platform to see all the instances of a driver being distracted. While an Uber spokesperson said the company was being more deliberate about the ratio of managers to vehicle operators — the company is filling about 55 roles for what it calls “mission specialists” — this new real-time alert system will help alleviate some of the difficulty of auditing driving behavior manually. That’s hugely important. A closer investigation of the fatal crash that took the life of Elaine Herzberg in Arizona revealed that Uber relied heavily on the humans sitting behind the wheel to react immediately in an emergency. And in this case the driver was distracted. In fact, it was later revealed that the driver was streaming a show on her phone while sitting behind the wheel. That’s the risk with depending on a human driver — they become too reliant on the automated technology to drive itself safely and, in turn, get distracted. To that end, Uber is also ensuring that the automatic emergency braking system that is already built into the car will be engaged no matter when it is being driven. Have more information or any tips?

These changes come to Uber as the competition for being one of the first companies with a network of self-driving cars — an important feat both technologically and financially — becomes steeper. From a pure miles-driven standpoint, Alphabet’s Waymo announced it had autonomously driven more than eight million miles on public roads just last week. At last count, Uber had only reached three million miles before it halted all of its self-driving testing in March. While the company doesn’t have to start entirely from scratch once it does start testing its autonomous technology again, Uber was struggling to meet internal goals in the lead up to the crash. As we first reported, Uber’s fleet of vehicles could only drive less than a mile before a safety driver had to take over in March 2017. As of March 2018, the company was still struggling to meet its goal of driving 13 miles without a driver taking over. While it was a meager increase from the year prior, it was still far lower than its competitors like Waymo, which said it drove an average of 5,600 miles before a driver had to take over control in 2017. At the core of this issue is safety. Companies building self-driving cars pitch it as a potentially life-saving technology, but those companies still have a lot to prove. That’s especially true as the U.S. Congress actively works to regulate autonomous technology. This article originally appeared on Recode.net.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“We’re not doing anything with blockchain,” said Matt Cutts, the acting administrator of the U.S. Digital Service. For now, at least, the tech-focused division of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget is focused on the more basic ways that technology can make Americans’ interactions with the government user-friendly. “I am less worried about machine learning, I am less worried about artificial intelligence or the blockchain,” Cutts said on the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher. “I am more worried about the veteran who calls the VA every single day at 9 am.” Cutts, who spent nearly 17 years at Google before joining the USDS in 2017, said that’s not a rhetorical example. There really was a veteran, named Charles, who was calling every day to check in on the status of a disability claim appeal. “All we did was implement a progress bar so that he knows where he stands out of 100,000-plus veterans,” Cutts said. “So even though he knows he might have a two-and-a-half-year-plus wait, just knowing where you stand in that queue makes you heard and respected and valued.” He urged tech workers to consider a temporary tour of duty in the government because applying Silicon Valley’s “agile practices” to things like veterans’ benefits or Medicare can make a huge difference in people’s lives. And contrary to what some might expect, he said the USDS’ work has remained just as nonpartisan under President Trump as it was under President Obama. “There is so much good work to be done — high-impact work that can help a regular person get access to the sorts of government services that they need to have,” Cutts said. You can listen to Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts. On the new podcast, Cutts did propose one big idea that could help everyone, both those working in government and everyday citizens: “Get rid of paper.” “I would be extremely ecstatic,” he said. “For example, H-1B visas. Millions of pieces of paper are shipped to a place, which then does a lottery, and ships all that paper back to the people who lost in the lottery. If you could just start with a preregistraton page that was digital ...” “We’re kind of used to seeing these pictures of supervisors’ offices with stacks and stacks up to the ceiling, which are unsearchable,” Cutts added. “Some people think they can do better by scanning or faxing stuff in, and then having an electronic version of that. The fact is, it needs to be digital-native from the beginning. That’s how it’s searchable, that’s how you can really check for errors.” If you like this show, you should also sample our other podcasts: If you like what we’re doing, please write a review on Apple Podcasts — and if you don’t, just tweet-strafe Kara.
